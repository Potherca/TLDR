## Introduction

My new favorite unintentional troll [John Slegers] recently [tweeted] (https://twitter.com/johnslegers/status/574881993810403328) a link to an
article by [Gilles Bowkett] called [Flaws In Scrum And Agile].

Although I agree with the original premise I have a lot of difficulty with both
the logic and the rational Bowkett uses to get his point across.

This is my teal deer version of his blog post and my opinion about it.

## TL;DR

In case you have not read the article, it outlines various things that Bowkett
feels are flawed in the Agile manifesto and the Scrum methodology. It states
that the agile manifesto is good but has become old, possibly even outdated in
light of contemporary tools. The author has problems with 4 of the 16 points
that make up the Manifesto and its principles. Scrum gives the author more reason
for complaint as, in his experience, things run smoother if the Scrum vocabulary
is avoided. Several Scrum ceremonies and artifacts get in the way of
adequately getting things done and the "distributed teams" model seems a better
fit for modern-day companies and projects.

## My opinion

The article basically breaks down into equal parts of (not very elegant)
bashing Scrum and stating perceived flaws of the Agile Manifesto that seem to
lie more with Bowkett's own view than with the subject being reviewed.

There are several logical fallacies and some contradictions that make the whole
thing feel more like a poorly put together rant rather than a serious
breakdown of the flaws inherent in Scrum. Mixing "Agile", the Agile Manifesto
and "Scrum" seemingly random also don't help clarity or readability.

This is a shame as a lot of the viewpoints in the article are quite valid and
the warning "Buyer beware" goes for processes just as well as it does for
products.

### The Good

The valid points I could salvage from the article are 4 score.

The "Scrum" vocabulary is flawed beyond repair and should be avoided. Even if
one were to use the scrum methodology, the vacabulary is misleading and best
left out. Just use already existing words instead of trying to assign a
different meaning to words that already mean something else.

Just as some teams use "Agile" as an excuse not do to technical design work, the
same goes for written communication a.k.a. documentation. Having a Distributed
Teams process combats this problem.

The benefit of distributed teams and open source software are responsible for a
lot of (commercial and technoligical) successful projects to a far larger extend
than often given credit for. It good to see someone explicitly mention this.

Some parts of the Agile Manifesto might benefit from a minor update or at least
a rewording. For instance, the delivery timescale can be shortened, the lines
between business and developers have become less strict and the importance of
various ubiquitous tools might be a welcome addition to the current phrasing.

### The Bad

A lot of the perceived problems with scrum seem to stem from personal experience
or (mis)interpretetion of "the rules".

At various points Bowkett states a certain "rule" is flawed but then goes on to
explain exactly how the rule can be made to work by slightly modifying it.
Wouldn't it seem logical that, maybe, that is how the "rule" was meant in the
first place? If a minor change in the definition fixes everything, the problem
may very well be with a flaw in the definition ascribed to the rule, rather than
the rule itself.

Face-to-face is still a superior way of communicating information than any other.
This is a sad part of being a mere human. Anything that one can write down can
be shared faster (and questioned/retorted easier) verbally. Its what we *do*.
This is the reason why [teachers aren't going to be replaced by robots] anytime
soon (or anytime *ever*). This mechanism does work even better when face-time is
prepared (for instance by putting things in writing before discussing it). That
way you get best of both worlds. Documentation and discussion. There is, however,
a very real space where people just "talk to talk" and for well-oiled teams this
time becomes less and less relevant and they will need to learn less from each
other. If we're going to rely solely on personal experience, I've often seen
conversation completely escalate over written communications that were resolved
almost instantly in person. Can I now claim written communication to be inferior?

### The Ugly

There are various quotes that paint a picture of a very narrow minded world view
from the part of the author. The two most prominent being:

 - "just about every software project on Earth today [...] starts with GitHub".
   Which blindly ignores the still very large part of the population still
   <del>stuck with</del> using SVN or all of the projects using Bitbucket,
   Gitlab or Gitorious (the last two are [becoming the same thing](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/)).
 - "I've never heard of anyone doing Scrum for fun in their free time." Well,
   other than the entertaining [TED talk by Bruce Feiler] on how to "do" Agile
   with your family there a many blogs on the subject. Maybe listening isn't the
   authors strenght?
   Supporting the authors point that "Scrum" is more flawed than "Agile", even
   the [Scrum Family] switched from Scrum to [Personal Kanban] to be more
   flexible.

There are also various logical fallacies:

 - "everybody's texting and you're still leaving voicemails". The opposite also
   holds true. Point being?
 - "The 'daily' part is silly. There's lots of technical work where 'I'll see
   you in a few days' is the only sensible thing to tell your colleagues" but in
   an earlier part the author claims that "the shorter timescale" can be
   measured in minutes and hours, not weeks and months (or... uhm days?). You
   can't use both opposing views depending on which point you want to make.
 - "a core principle of the Agile Manifesto puts it in conflict with the entire
   open source movement" Quite a grandiose statement to make based only on a
   personal opinion. Also because I don't think "the entire" movement will agree.
 - "Waterfall used too much written communication but Agile doesn't use enough."
   but earlier the author states "Remote work requires a ton of writing, and
   that's one of the best things about it." So... remote work is Waterfall? :-P

## Conclusion

The authors gripe seems to be mostly with the sorry state of what most companies
claim to be "Scrum" or "Agile" rather than with the actual Agile Manifesto.

Because of the various flaws with the text, the underlying opinion comes across
less loud and clear than it could. Scrum may have had its day and other
(better?) processes are available for development teams that truely want to add
more value for a customer, project or product.
