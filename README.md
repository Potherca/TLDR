# TL;DR

Can't be arsed to form an opinion yourself about various articles, books, talks
or presentations? Have one of mine. -- Here's one I made earlier!

## Longer version

For some people reading articles or (god forbid) an entire book is just *too*
much work. Talks and presentations just take *way* too long to watch.

To offer help I have taken the trouble of doing this for people so they won't
have to.

The result (including my opinion) is stored here. For, you know, safe keeping.
