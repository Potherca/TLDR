 Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The agile manifesto is good but has become old, possibly even outdated.

 Remote work and distributed companies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The face-to-face rule is flawed
 - It is better than what there was at the time (e.g. waterfall documents) but
   these days communication tends to be more visual than verbal.
 - Written communication is better than verbal because it caused documentation
   which "Agile" does not use enough of.

 Our process is mostly just Github
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - "just about every software project on Earth today [...] starts with GitHub"
 - Conversations parallel to Github are recaps for non-technical participants
 - Every company benefits from distributed teams, even if it is just by-proxy
 - A core principle of "Agile" puts it in conflict with the entire open source movement

 Agile development: the bad parts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Shorter timescales have become even shorter
 - "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" but now "Scrum" has
   become the process
 - One needs to master tools to do a job
 - "everybody's texting and you're still leaving voicemails"
 - Tools shape interactions, "The media is the message"
 - Business and developers must work together on a daily basis
    - "I've never heard of anyone doing Scrum for fun in their free time."
    - "Daily Basis" is (sometimes) too short

 - Problems with agile culture
 - Waterfall still has its place

 Semantics are important for knowledge workers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - We don't use scrum terminology
   - Sprint should be called "iteration" or "marathon"
   - negative frame of reference. "backlog." "Sprints" and "spikes" cause meaningless urgency
 - [Quoting Greg Caines]
   - Commitment should be "estimate"
 - [Quoting "Agile fluency"]
   - Only 5% achieve a 3 out of 4 stars fluency after 1 to 5 years
 - Have no need for
   - "Blockers"
   - Daily Stand-up
   - Planning Days
   - Mandatory Meetings
   - Measured Velocity
 - Instead prefer
   - Asynchronous Meetings
   - Agile over Scrum

 Caveat: We make exceptions all the time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - With clients or start-ups
 - Prefer to use eXtreme Programming instead
